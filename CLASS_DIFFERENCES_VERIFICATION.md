# Class Differences Verification

## Current State

The curriculum DOES have differentiation, but it might not be obvious enough. Here's what's different:

### 1. **Step Descriptions** - ✅ Different
- Vibe Surfer: `[AI-Driven: Let AI generate the solution...]`
- Co-Pilot: `[Hybrid Approach: You architect, AI helps...]`
- 10x Architect: `[Expert Mode: You write the code, AI provides help...]`

### 2. **Learning Objectives** - ✅ Different
- Vibe Surfer: `(Easy Mode: Learn by observing AI-generated solutions...)`
- Co-Pilot: `(Intermediate: Hybrid methodology. You design and plan...)`
- 10x Architect: `(Expert: AI is just a tool. You write the code yourself...)`

### 3. **Tool Instructions** - ✅ Different
Each class has different step-by-step instructions

### 4. **AI Tools** - ⚠️ PARTIALLY Different
Some steps use different tools:
- skeleton-0 (UI Design): Vibe Surfer = galileo-ai, Co-Pilot = figma-ai, 10x = uizard-ai ✅
- skeleton-2 (TodoList): Vibe Surfer = galileo-ai, Co-Pilot/10x = v0/cursor ⚠️
- skeleton-5 (Styling): Vibe Surfer = midjourney, Co-Pilot = figma-ai, 10x = gemini ✅
- Many other steps use the SAME tool (cursor, chatgpt, gemini, claude) ⚠️

### 5. **Step Titles** - ❌ SAME
All classes have the same step titles, which makes them look identical at first glance.

## The Problem

The user sees the same step titles and many of the same AI tools, so it LOOKS like the same content even though the descriptions, instructions, and prompts are different.

## Solution Needed

1. Make step titles more unique per class
2. Use MORE different AI tools per class
3. Make the methodology differences more visually prominent in the UI
