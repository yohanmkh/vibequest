   - **Security Audit (quality-2)**:
     - Vibe Surfer/Co-Pilot: Claude
     - 10x Architect: Perplexity
   
   - **Performance Testing (quality-3)**:
     - Vibe Surfer/Co-Pilot: Claude
     - 10x Architect: Phind
   
   - **Environment Variables (prod-1)**:
     - Vibe Surfer/Co-Pilot: Gemini
     - 10x Architect: Perplexity
   
   - **CI/CD (prod-2)**:
     - Vibe Surfer/Co-Pilot: Claude
     - 10x Architect: Phind
   
   - **Build Optimization (prod-3)**:
     - Vibe Surfer/10x: Cursor
     - Co-Pilot: Cursor Composer
   
   - **Monitoring (prod-5)**:
     - Vibe Surfer/Co-Pilot: Claude
     - 10x Architect: Perplexity

2. **XP Rewards**:
   - Vibe Surfer: Base XP
   - Co-Pilot: Base XP + 5
   - 10x Architect: Base XP + 10

3. **Coffee Costs**:
   - Vibe Surfer: Base cost
   - Co-Pilot: Base cost
   - 10x Architect: Base cost + 5

4. **Learning Objectives**:
   - Vibe Surfer: Base objective
   - Co-Pilot: Base + "(Intermediate: Focus on code quality and architecture)"
   - 10x Architect: Base + "(Expert: Deep technical understanding required)"

5. **Tool Instructions**:
   - Different step-by-step instructions based on which AI tool is used
   - Different complexity levels in instructions

### ⚠️ What's the SAME:

- **Step Titles**: All classes have the same 29 step titles
- **Step Order**: All classes follow the same sequence
- **Step Descriptions**: Same descriptions (except stack customization)
- **Step Types**: Same step types (configuration, code-generation, testing, deployment)
- **Dependencies**: Same dependency chains

## Recommendation: Add More Unique Differentiation

The current system differentiates through AI tools and difficulty adjustments, but could be more unique. Consider:

### Option 1: Add Class-Specific Steps
- **Vibe Surfer**: Add "Prompt Battle" mini-games
- **Co-Pilot**: Add "Code Review Challenge" steps
- **10x Architect**: Add "Debugging Challenges" and "Architecture Decisions"

### Option 2: Different Step Content
- **Vibe Surfer**: More guided, simpler explanations
- **Co-Pilot**: Focus on architecture and best practices
- **10x Architect**: Deep technical challenges, optimization focus

### Option 3: Different Step Sequences
- **Vibe Surfer**: Skip some advanced steps
- **Co-Pilot**: Include all steps
- **10x Architect**: Add extra advanced steps (performance, security, scalability)

---

## Current Assessment:

**The steps are the same structure but different execution:**
- ✅ Different AI tools (good differentiation)
- ✅ Different difficulty (XP/Coffee adjustments)
- ✅ Different learning focus (objectives)
- ⚠️ Same step titles and flow (could be more unique)

**Verdict**: The classes ARE differentiated, but primarily through tool selection and difficulty, not through unique step content or challenges.
