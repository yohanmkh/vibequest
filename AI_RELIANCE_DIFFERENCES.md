# AI Reliance Differences Between Classes

## Summary of Changes

The curriculum now reflects **three distinct AI reliance methodologies**:

### 🎯 **Vibe Surfer (Easy Mode) - Total AI Reliance**
- **Philosophy**: AI does the work, student learns by observing
- **Approach**: Let AI generate complete solutions
- **Student Role**: Understand what AI created, learn concepts
- **AI Role**: Generate everything, provide complete solutions

**Key Characteristics:**
- Descriptions include: `[AI-Driven: Let AI generate the solution, focus on understanding the concepts.]`
- Learning objectives: `(Easy Mode: Learn by observing AI-generated solutions. Focus on understanding concepts rather than writing code yourself.)`
- Tool instructions: "Let AI generate everything", "Accept the complete code", "Your job: Understand what AI created"
- Prompts: "Create complete...", "Generate everything for me", "Generate the full implementation"
- Best practices: "Let AI generate the complete solution", "Focus on understanding the generated code"

### 🤝 **Co-Pilot (Intermediate) - Hybrid Methodology**
- **Philosophy**: Student and AI work together collaboratively
- **Approach**: Student designs/plans, AI helps implement
- **Student Role**: Architect solutions, review and refine AI code
- **AI Role**: Help implement student's designs

**Key Characteristics:**
- Descriptions include: `[Hybrid Approach: You architect the solution, AI helps implement it. Work together with AI.]`
- Learning objectives: `(Intermediate: Hybrid methodology. You design and plan, AI helps implement. Focus on code quality, architecture, and understanding the implementation.)`
- Tool instructions: "Plan your approach first", "You design, AI implements", "Work together", "Review and refine"
- Prompts: "I need...", "Help me implement...", "Work with me to implement this"
- Best practices: "Plan your approach before using AI", "Design the structure, let AI implement details", "Work collaboratively with AI"

### 🛠️ **10x Architect (Hard Mode) - AI as a Helper**
- **Philosophy**: Student does the work, AI provides help when needed
- **Approach**: Write code yourself, use AI only for guidance
- **Student Role**: Write all code, solve problems independently
- **AI Role**: Provide help, debugging, learning support

**Key Characteristics:**
- Descriptions include: `[Expert Mode: You write the code, AI provides guidance and help when stuck. Deep technical understanding required.]`
- Learning objectives: `(Expert: AI is just a tool. You write the code yourself, use AI for help, debugging, and learning. Deep technical understanding and problem-solving skills required.)`
- Tool instructions: "Write code yourself first", "If stuck, ask for help", "Use AI only for guidance", "Understand every line"
- Prompts: "Help me understand...", "What's the best approach...", "Can you explain the concepts...", "[Write it yourself]"
- Best practices: "Write code yourself first", "Use AI only when you need help", "Understand every line of code you write", "AI is a helper, not a crutch"

## Examples of Differences

### Example 1: UI Design Step (skeleton-0)

**Vibe Surfer:**
- Instructions: "Let Galileo AI generate the complete design - no need to plan details yourself"
- Prompt: "Create a complete todo app interface..."
- Result: AI does all design work

**Co-Pilot:**
- Instructions: "Plan your UI structure first", "You refine: Adjust colors, spacing..."
- Prompt: "I want a todo app with... Generate a base design, then I'll refine it"
- Result: Student plans, AI helps build

**10x Architect:**
- Instructions: "Design your UI architecture first", "You make all design decisions"
- Prompt: "Show me examples... then design your own"
- Result: Student designs everything, AI is just a tool

### Example 2: Component Creation (skeleton-1)

**Vibe Surfer:**
- "Let Cursor generate everything - accept the complete code"
- "Your job: Understand what Cursor created"
- Prompt: "Create a complete App component... Generate everything for me"

**Co-Pilot:**
- "Plan your App component structure first"
- "Review Cursor's code and refine it to match your design"
- Prompt: "I want to create... Help me implement this design"

**10x Architect:**
- "Write the component code yourself"
- "If stuck, press Cmd+K and ask: 'Help me with this specific part'"
- Prompt: "Can you help me understand the best structure? [Write it yourself]"

### Example 3: State Management (skeleton-3)

**Vibe Surfer:**
- "Let ChatGPT generate the full implementation"
- "Copy the complete code"
- Prompt: "Create complete state management code... Generate the full implementation for me"

**Co-Pilot:**
- "Plan your state management approach first"
- "Refine the code to match your architecture"
- Prompt: "Help me implement state management... Work with me to implement this"

**10x Architect:**
- "Study state management concepts first"
- "Write the state management code yourself"
- Prompt: "Can you explain the concepts and best practices? I'll write the code myself"

## Updated Step Elements

All steps now have class-specific:

1. **Descriptions**: Include methodology tags `[AI-Driven]`, `[Hybrid Approach]`, `[Expert Mode]`
2. **Learning Objectives**: Include difficulty-specific guidance
3. **Tool Instructions**: Different step-by-step processes per class
4. **Example Prompts**: Different prompt styles (generate vs. help vs. explain)
5. **Prompt Templates**: Different approaches (complete generation vs. collaborative vs. guidance)
6. **Tool Tips**: Class-specific tips
7. **Best Practices**: Methodology-specific practices
8. **Explanations**: Different explanations per class

## Impact

Now the three classes are **truly differentiated**:
- ✅ Different AI reliance levels
- ✅ Different learning approaches
- ✅ Different student roles
- ✅ Different AI roles
- ✅ Different prompt styles
- ✅ Different best practices

The curriculum now properly reflects:
- **Easy**: Total AI reliance (AI does work, student learns)
- **Intermediate**: Hybrid (student + AI work together)
- **Hard**: AI as helper (student does work, AI helps)
